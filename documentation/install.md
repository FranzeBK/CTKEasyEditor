**To install and run script (assuming you have git and pip):**

```
$ git clone https://github.com/coding-beagle/ctkeasyeditor.git
```

Navigate to scripts, e.g.

```
$ cd ctkeasyeditor
```

Recommended: start a new python virtual environment in the scripts directory:
Depending on your IDE (i.e. vscode) you might need to set the venv manually

```
$ cd scripts
$ python -m venv venv
$ venv/scripts/activate.ps1
```

Install the required packages:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally run main.py

```
$ python main.py
```
