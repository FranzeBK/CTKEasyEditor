# CTKEasyEditor

An easy GUI editor for CustomTKinter in Python

Note this is still a work in progress:
i.e. there is **NO** export to python files yet (to be implemented over the next few days)

Currently this is just the skeleton and I am experimenting with the design of different elements.
Right now it seems to work okay, and the current implementation includes:

- Easy Application Window Settings Management
- Easy Active Widgets manager
- Drag, and (limited) snapping capability on added widgets
- The groundwork for adding all of the editing functionality

To be implemented soon:

- Export to .py file,
- A way to edit the configuration of widgets on the go
- Some basic theme management

Yes, the UI looks bad right now. Yes, I will rework it using this tool when I make a version of it that works adequately.
