Big progress day, uni exams are done

Todo:

- Continue adding the editing menus for each widget (the specific ones are annoying)
- Add Edit -> Preferences

- - Also things like what is the ctk library called
- Add Editor saving system, i.e. File -> save, File -> open etc, (unsure of implementation)
- Active widget hierarchy adjustments (one fears the thought of touching activewidgethandler.py)
- Theme editor implementation

Bugs:

- Need to reopen window with all drawn elemnts when it is closed
- Not a bug, but figure out a way to only import PIL libraries if it is needed, e.g. if there is an image object or something
